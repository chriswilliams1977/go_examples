#these days requests go to a program running on a server that generates response for server to return
#net/http package handles requests to an app - included a small web server
#when you call http.HandleFunc with handler funcs upi are passing the handler func itself to be stored and called later

#in go functions are first class citizens meaning they can be assigned to vars then called by those vars
#when passing a func as param it has to be the right type
#for example http.HandleFunc expect func(ResponseWriter, *Request)
#a functions params and return value are part of its type
#a var that holds a fun needs to specify its params and return values
