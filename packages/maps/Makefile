#Maps are like an index in a book
#where you have a collection of things (pages) and you can look up where that value is
#every value has a label to look up

#To check values in a slice or array you have to search through all values in the slice
#then take action
#like a big stack of office papers, you have to go through one by define
#map is all those papers sorted in folders

#slice and array can only use int as indexs
#map can use any type as a key
#values and keys have to be of same type
#but key can be different type to value
#define by using map[string]float64
#use make to create a map if you dont know values up front otherwise use literals
