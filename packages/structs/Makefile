#struct = structure
#allows you to store mixed data types together e.g a user
#bit like an object
#array, slice and map values can only store same data type
#use type definition to create instance of that type to use

#use pointers to update a struct
#Better pass a pointer to a struct as a param to a func rather than the struct itself
#because only one copy of struct is in memory, if you pass struct there are two copies of struct
